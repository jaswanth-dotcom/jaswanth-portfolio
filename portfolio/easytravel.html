    <h2>Easy Travel ‚Äì Your Smart Travel Companion:</h2>

    <h3>üß≠ Project Overview</h3>
    <p>Easy Travel is a mobile app that solves real-world problems for travelers who struggle with unfamiliar locations, tracking expenses, and booking hotels. It brings all these features together in one clean, user-friendly experience.</p>
    <p>It was created with solo travelers, tourists, and groups in mind, offering location discovery, smart expense tracking, and hotel booking ‚Äî all in one place.</p>

    <h3>üé® Design Process & Research</h3>
    <p>Although formal user research wasn't conducted, the app was inspired by real observations of traveler pain points. Apps like Google Maps and Booking.com influenced the structure and layout, while sketches were done on paper to plan the app's core screens.</p>

    <h3>üíª Design Execution</h3>
    <p>The design was built in Figma, using #007BFF (sky blue) as the primary color to convey trust and calmness. The Inter font was chosen for its simplicity and readability. The app has 4 key screens: Home (location), Hotel Booking, Expense Tracker, and Profile. A full interactive prototype was created using Figma.</p>

    <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Solutions</h3>
    <p>As Jaswanth's first UI/UX project, challenges included time management and designing intuitive user flows. These were overcome through structured planning, learning while designing, and taking inspiration from successful existing apps.</p>

    <h3>üèÅ Final Outcome & Learnings</h3>
    <p>The project marked a turning point in Jaswanth‚Äôs UI/UX journey. He learned about the importance of clear structure, design consistency, and how solving real problems is the heart of good UX. In the future, he plans to expand the app with more features and an even more refined flow.</p>
